# Snake

## A retro snake web game powered by the .NET framework


This project was built to provide a nostalgic snake gameplay in a modern UI
enviroment. It was inspired by a version of snake programmed by Taneli Armanto
in 1997 for Nokia monochrome 6110 phones which utilized a block-like snake
without rounded corners and edges. Play this game:
